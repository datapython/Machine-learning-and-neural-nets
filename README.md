# Machine-learning-and-neural-nets
Being a complete newbie, I am following and modifying Daniel shiffman's tutorials on Machine Learning 
and am trying to code it in Processing and/or JavaScript p5.js for this repository.

I think all this code runs correctly right down to the Raspberry Pi.. will confirm later.

I might also use python in later uploads

Hoping to make a library for python soon.
