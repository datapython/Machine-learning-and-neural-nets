Keep in mind that it uses the gradient descent method and hence the best fit line will gradually learn. Even with two points.
The odd No. Squared method gives an instantaneous result. 
However the gradient descent is more generic and I did this mainly because gradient descent will be my backbone for neural networks.
Again I don't claim its original. Its based on Daniel Shiffman's videos.

It's a technique in the learning curve .. That's all.
